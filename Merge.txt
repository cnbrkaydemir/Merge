[16,21,11,8,12,22]

Let's go through the steps

[16,21,11] - [8,12,22] //Divide into 2 equal parts
[16] - [21,11] - [8,12] - [22] //Divide again
[16] - [21] - [11] - [8] - [12] - [22] //Apply merge algorithm for each pair of length 2
[16] - [11,21] - [8,12] - [22] //Apply merge again
[11,16,21] - [8,12,22] //Apply the last merge
[8,11,12,16,21,22] // The array is fully sorted

And finally Big-O notation

if 2^k=n then logn=k so we can state that the sorting complexity is O(nlogn)
